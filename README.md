This repo contains a bunch of scripts which can be useful
for typical toolchain maintenance tasks:
* build compilers (gcc-build and llvm-build)
* test a change (gcc-bootstrap-and-regtest)
* GCC git bisector (gcc-bisect)
* compare ChangeLogs of 2 OSS projects (gnu-compare-projects)
* compare 2 sets of Dejagnu reports (deja-compare-checks, gcc-compare-checks)
* configure, build and install a typical Autoconf project (configure-build-install)
* set up ctags for GCC source dir (gcc-index)
* run GCC compiler proper under debugger (gcc-debug)
* insert license header into all files in a folder (insert-license-header)
* update copyright comments in all files in a folder (update-copyrights)
* generate tags for C++ (cpptags) and Python (pytags) repos
* boilerplate code for shell (sh-boilerplate) and Python (py-boilerplate) scripts
* print predefined GCC macro (gcc-predefs)

All the code is MIT-licensed.
